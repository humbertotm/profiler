[] Return on working capital (free cash flow / working capital)

[] ENGINEERING TODOS
[] Remove the need for a test db to test code to set a github pipeline.
   - Redesign code to have a layer that handles data fetching and caching regardless of
     data we're handling.
   - Try the approach were this functions does not know anything about how it will fetch
     and cache. It will be passed functions for each of these purposes as arguments.
   - Otherwise check out clojure.core/with-redefs to mock functions during testing.
